### Im currently working on migrating my workflow over to swayfx as i3 (still) is my favourite window manager, but many of my apps require wayland support. 

# i'm hoping to include 2 themes -

## Nordic (using the nordic gtk theme)

## Dracula (using dracula gtk theme)

at this current time, I can only get lxqt's polkit working, but I should be able to get xfce/cosmic/cinnamon working.
